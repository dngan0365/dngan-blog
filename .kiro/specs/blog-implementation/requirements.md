Large Language Models (LLMs)

Vector Databases

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Recommender Systems

The blog will also include a dedicated About Me page for personal introduction and context, and posts will be organized by category for easy navigation and future scalability.

Deployment will be handled through GitHub Pages, utilizing Next.js for its performance, flexibility, and modern web development features. The site will be statically generated and continuously deployed via GitHub Actions.
