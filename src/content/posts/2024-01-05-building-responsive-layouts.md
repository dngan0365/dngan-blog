# Building Responsive Layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox

Creating responsive layouts is a fundamental skill for modern web developers. With CSS Grid and Flexbox, we have powerful tools to build flexible, maintainable layouts that work across all devices.

## Understanding the Fundamentals

### CSS Grid vs Flexbox
- **CSS Grid**: Best for two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns)
- **Flexbox**: Perfect for one-dimensional layouts (either row or column)

## CSS Grid Essentials

### Basic Grid Setup
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Responsive Grid Areas
```css
.layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
  grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .layout {
    grid-template-areas:
      "header"
      "main"
      "sidebar"
      "footer";
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```

## Flexbox for Component Layouts

### Navigation Bar
```css
.navbar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1rem;
}

.nav-links {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
  list-style: none;
}
```

### Card Layouts
```css
.card-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1rem;
}

.card {
  flex: 1 1 300px;
  min-width: 0; /* Prevents flex items from overflowing */
}
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Intrinsic Web Design
Using `auto-fit` and `minmax()` for truly responsive grids:

```css
.responsive-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

### Container Queries (Modern Approach)
```css
@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Mobile-First Approach**: Start with mobile styles and enhance for larger screens
2. **Use Logical Properties**: `margin-inline`, `padding-block` for better internationalization
3. **Test Across Devices**: Use browser dev tools to test various screen sizes
4. **Performance Considerations**: Avoid complex nested grids that might impact performance

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't use fixed heights unless absolutely necessary
- Avoid using `float` for layout (it's outdated)
- Don't forget to test with real content, not just placeholder text
- Remember that `flex-shrink: 0` can prevent unwanted shrinking

## Conclusion

Modern CSS layout techniques give us unprecedented control over responsive design. By combining CSS Grid for page-level layouts and Flexbox for component-level arrangements, you can create robust, flexible designs that work beautifully across all devices.

The key is understanding when to use each tool and how they complement each other in creating exceptional user experiences.
