# Introduction to Vector Databases: The Foundation of Modern AI

Vector databases have emerged as a critical infrastructure component for modern AI applications. As we build more sophisticated systems that rely on semantic search, recommendation engines, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), understanding vector databases becomes essential.

## What Are Vector Databases?

Vector databases are specialized storage systems designed to handle high-dimensional vector data efficiently. Unlike traditional databases that store structured data in rows and columns, vector databases store mathematical representations of data as vectors (arrays of numbers).

### Key Characteristics:
- **High-dimensional data storage** (typically 100-4096 dimensions)
- **Similarity search capabilities** using distance metrics
- **Optimized indexing** for fast retrieval
- **Scalability** for billions of vectors

## Why Vector Databases Matter

### Traditional Search vs. Vector Search

```python
# Traditional keyword search
query = "red sports car"
results = database.search(keywords=["red", "sports", "car"])

# Vector search
query_embedding = model.encode("red sports car")
results = vector_db.similarity_search(query_embedding, top_k=10)
```

Vector search understands semantic meaning, not just exact keyword matches.

## Popular Vector Database Solutions

### 1. Pinecone
- **Pros**: Fully managed, easy to use, excellent performance
- **Cons**: Proprietary, can be expensive at scale
- **Best for**: Production applications, startups

### 2. Weaviate
- **Pros**: Open source, GraphQL API, built-in ML models
- **Cons**: More complex setup
- **Best for**: Flexible deployments, custom requirements

### 3. Chroma
- **Pros**: Simple Python API, great for prototyping
- **Cons**: Limited scalability
- **Best for**: Development, small to medium projects

### 4. Qdrant
- **Pros**: Rust-based performance, rich filtering
- **Cons**: Smaller community
- **Best for**: High-performance applications

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Semantic Search
```python
# Example: Document search
documents = [
    "Machine learning algorithms",
    "Deep neural networks",
    "Natural language processing"
]

# Convert to vectors
embeddings = model.encode(documents)
vector_db.upsert(embeddings, metadata=documents)

# Search
query = "AI techniques"
results = vector_db.search(model.encode(query))
```

### 2. Recommendation Systems
- **Content-based filtering**: Similar items based on features
- **Collaborative filtering**: User behavior patterns
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combining multiple signals

### 3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
```python
# RAG pipeline
def rag_query(question):
    # 1. Convert question to vector
    query_vector = embedding_model.encode(question)
    
    # 2. Retrieve relevant documents
    relevant_docs = vector_db.search(query_vector, top_k=5)
    
    # 3. Generate answer with context
    context = "\n".join([doc.content for doc in relevant_docs])
    answer = llm.generate(f"Context: {context}\nQuestion: {question}")
    
    return answer
```

## Distance Metrics

### Cosine Similarity
- **Range**: -1 to 1 (1 = identical, 0 = orthogonal, -1 = opposite)
- **Best for**: Text embeddings, normalized vectors
- **Formula**: `cos(θ) = (A·B) / (||A|| ||B||)`

### Euclidean Distance
- **Range**: 0 to ∞ (0 = identical)
- **Best for**: Spatial data, image embeddings
- **Formula**: `d = √Σ(ai - bi)²`

### Dot Product
- **Range**: -∞ to ∞
- **Best for**: When vector magnitude matters
- **Formula**: `A·B = Σ(ai × bi)`

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Strategies
1. **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**
   - Fast approximate search
   - Good recall vs. speed tradeoff

2. **IVF (Inverted File)**
   - Partitions vector space
   - Good for large datasets

3. **LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing)**
   - Hash similar vectors to same buckets
   - Probabilistic approach

### Optimization Tips
```python
# 1. Batch operations
vector_db.upsert_batch(vectors, batch_size=1000)

# 2. Use appropriate dimensions
# More dimensions ≠ better results
optimal_dims = 384  # Often sufficient for many tasks

# 3. Normalize vectors when using cosine similarity
normalized_vectors = vectors / np.linalg.norm(vectors, axis=1, keepdims=True)

# 4. Filter before vector search when possible
results = vector_db.search(
    vector=query_vector,
    filter={"category": "technology"},
    top_k=10
)
```

## Getting Started: Simple Example

```python
import chromadb
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Initialize
client = chromadb.Client()
collection = client.create_collection("my_docs")
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Add documents
documents = [
    "Vector databases store high-dimensional data",
    "Machine learning models create embeddings",
    "Similarity search finds related content"
]

embeddings = model.encode(documents)
collection.add(
    embeddings=embeddings.tolist(),
    documents=documents,
    ids=[f"doc_{i}" for i in range(len(documents))]
)

# Search
query = "How do you store ML data?"
query_embedding = model.encode([query])
results = collection.query(
    query_embeddings=query_embedding.tolist(),
    n_results=2
)

print(results['documents'])
```

## Future Trends

### 1. Multimodal Vectors
- Combining text, image, and audio embeddings
- Cross-modal search capabilities

### 2. Sparse-Dense Hybrid Search
- Combining keyword and semantic search
- Best of both worlds approach

### 3. Edge Deployment
- Smaller, optimized vector databases
- Local inference and search
